# Flask-Spotify-Search-App-For-Websites
You can use this web app by making some changes on it. 
To make sure this app is working, 
you can use it via changing the request link in the index.html (app/static/index.html) file to your localhost and use visual studio live server.
After editing index.html, open the flask file in your computer.
Then open index.html and just search your song.
Important Note: To make it work, you first log in spotify for developers and get your spotify client id and spotify client secret. 
Then put these codes into to passenger_wsgi.py file >>> "spotify-client-id", "spotify-client-secret"
Enjoy it!
